        <h2>1. Website Visitors</h2>
        <p>Like most website operators, Cx Inc collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Cx Inc&#x27;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Cx Inc&#x27;s visitors use its website. From time to time, Cx Inc may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
        <p>Cx Inc also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://cxgeneral.store blog posts. Cx Inc only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
        <h2>2. Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>Certain visitors to Cx Inc&#x27;s websites choose to interact with Cx Inc in ways that require Cx Inc to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Cx Inc gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at https://cxgeneral.store to provide a username and email address.</p>
        <h2>3. Security</h2>
        <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        <h2>4. Cx Inc uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h2>
        <p>Cx Inc uses the remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven&#x27;t completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone&#x27;s past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google&#x27;s privacy policy.</p>
        <p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin.</p>
        <h2>5. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>Cx Inc discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Cx Inc&#x27;s behalf or to provide services available at Cx Inc&#x27;s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Cx Inc&#x27;s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Cx Inc will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Cx Inc discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Cx Inc believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Cx Inc, third parties or the public at large.</p>
        <p>If you are a registered user of https://cxgeneral.store and have supplied your email address, Cx Inc may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what&#x27;s going on with Cx Inc and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Cx Inc takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
        <h2>6. Aggregated Statistics</h2>
        <p>Cx Inc may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Cx Inc may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Cx Inc does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>
        <h2>7. Cookies</h2>
        <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, Cx Inc uses &quot;Cookies&quot;, similar technologies and services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.</p>
        <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor&#x27;s computer, and that the visitor&#x27;s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Cx Inc uses cookies to help Cx Inc identify and track visitors, their usage of https://cxgeneral.store, and their website access preferences. Cx Inc visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Cx Inc&#x27;s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Cx Inc&#x27;s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
        <p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to Cx Inc&#x27;s use of cookies.</p>
        <h2>8. E-commerce</h2>
        <p>Those who engage in transactions with Cx Inc – by purchasing Cx Inc&#x27;s services or products, are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Cx Inc collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor&#x27;s interaction with Cx Inc. Cx Inc does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
        <h2>9. Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Cx Inc may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Cx Inc&#x27;s sole discretion. Cx Inc encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
